title: Announcing our new game Ancient Rivals!
---
Hello there. We are **Sand Sphere Games**, a group of game developers from Russia. This is our very first blog post about what we are working on. Finally, we are ready to announce our game **Ancient Rivals**, which will be released later on mobile platforms.

But first, lets talk a bit about the project's history. During 3rd or 4th quarter of 2013 the project was founded by single person. By the beginning of 2014 some more people joined the team, which has grown up to total of 5 people: 3d TA, programmer, 3d artist, 3d animator and a game design consultant. 

The team works from different cities, hundreds kilometers from each other. We are operating literally on zero budget, just like most indie developers. But enough of that, lets get back to the game!

As was mentioned before, the game will be released on all major mobile platforms like **Google Play** and **Apple Appstore**. Genre of the game is top-down action RPG.
 
**Main features:**

- Unusual setting on the edge between fantasy and sci-fi.
- Fast-paced gameplay with unique featuers for an RPG game (more info later, stay tuned!).
- 3 totally different heroes at the beginning, more with game updates.
- Battles with hordes of monsters and their generals.
- Modern 3d graphics.

Finally, here comes our first **video** where we show a couple of levels and one of our heroes. But I want to point out that it is pre-alpha: a lot of stuff is missing and a lot of stuff will be improved.
