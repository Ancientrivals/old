title: Announcing our new game Ancient Rivals!
---
Hello everybody. We are an indie gamedev team called **Sand Sphere Games**. In this blog we will share all kind of news about our project **Ancient Rivals**, which is mobile hack&slash game in fantasy settings with some sci-fi elements.

The development of the project started in late 2013. At that time we were quite unexperienced and made a number of mistakes. Our team back then consisted of 5 people, but most of them left and we have decided to temporary close the project. A few months ago we have started rebuilding the team and the project.

Today only 2 people working on the game:

- Kirill as sole programmer.
- Artem as a jack-of-all-trades.

At this point we can show only old pre-alpha video and a couple of fresh environmental screenshots (look for them in the following blog post).

Gameplay will look somewhat like Diablo, - you will be able to choose a character with unique set of abilities and spells, receive a number of quests and then kill some monsters, of course.

**Some background story behind the game world:**

The game is set in medieval world. A few thousands years ago there was a civilization with outstanding technology, including spacecraft, but one day they just disappeared. A lot of artifacts left on the planet. Their power is immense, if you manage to find out how they work. They can bring peaces and prosperity, but they can also bring death and destruction. Depends in whos hand those piece of technology will land.
In order to prevent catastrophic events, the Secret Service was founded. It consists of professional politicians and soldiers, whos work is to find and neutralize dangerous remains of old civilizations. The player will be able to join the Secret Service and play as one of its agents.

As for the tech, the game is being created using **Unity** engine. When we started we used Unity 4, but lately we had to switch to 5-th generation. We had to rewrite some code and fix some assets, but new uGUI and Enlighten totally worth it. As we work on the game, we will share not only news, but all kind of technical articles and tutorials aimed towards other game developers.

See you!
