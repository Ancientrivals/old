Usually we post on Mondays, but we are too excited to wait to share this update on 3d-animation in our game. But first, GUI effects test:

We don't have an artist in the team (we both are mostly tech guys), so we have decided to pick up some stuff on the Asset Store to fill some gaps in the game's art. Particulary we have picked new Hero and now making it alive with mecanim and root motion animation.

We havent worked with root motion animation before, but it looks really good. Check this prototype Run animation that consists of three stages: start running, run cycle and slow down / stop animation.
You might notice that the character's leg at the beginnng and end of run cycle end up at the very position of where the must be at combat idle animation.

We also are working on combat system. 
Here you can see how we test combo of three consequential attacks.

While it isn't implemented in-game yet, we are testing "charged" attack: at first the hero takes some time to charge powerful attack and the unleashes massive area of effect damage :)
