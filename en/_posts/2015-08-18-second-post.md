---

As we mentioned before, we have restructured the project and the team and now are actively working on the game. Every week we are planning to post news about Ancient Rivals, but we also will post different technical articles for game developers, especially for those working with Unity.
Today we would like to share a couple of fresh screenshots of game levels.
